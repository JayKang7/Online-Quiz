    </p><p style="margin-top:45px;">From Xray is this optional 2.5mm carbon main chassis for the X12â€™21. Machined from 2.5mm hard high-grade graphite material with a specially-designed compound which is a good option for low grip carpet racing, as well as asphalt. The graphite material is softer than aluminium, allowing the chassis to generate more traction. The chassis was redesigned to accommodate the front Tweak-Free Suspension and the rear Tweak-Free POD System, while the side link mounting system was redesigned as well and is mounted directly to the chassis and the chassis features slots for adjustment of the servo mount position.</p>
